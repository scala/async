# Scala Async Project

## Quick start

 - Add `scala-async.jar` to your classpath
 - Use Scala 2.10.0

```scala
import ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import scala.async.Async.{async, await}

val future = async {
  val f1 = async { ...; true }
  val f2 = async { ...; 42 }
  if (await(f1)) await(f2) else 0
}
```

## What is `async`?

`async` marks a block of asynchronous code. Such a block usually contains
one or more `await` calls, which marks a point at which the computation
will be suspended until the awaited `Future` is complete.

By default, `async` blocks operate on `scala.concurrent.{Future, Promise}`.
The system can be adapted to alternative implementations of the
`Future` pattern.

Consider the following example:

```scala
def slowCalcFuture: Future[Int] = ...             // 01
def combined: Future[Int] = async {               // 02
  await(slowCalcFuture) + await(slowCalcFuture)   // 03
}
val x: Int = Await.result(combined, 10.seconds)   // 05
```

Lines 1 defines an asynchronous method: it returns a `Future`.

Line 3 begins an `async` block. During compilation,
the contents of this block will be analyzed to identify
the `await` calls, and transformed into non-blocking
code.

Control flow will immediately pass to line 5, as the
computation in the `async` block is not executed
on the caller's thread.

Line 4 begins by triggering `slowCalcFuture`, and then
suspending until it has been calculating. Only after it
has finished, we trigger it again, and suspend again.
Finally, we add the results and complete `combined`, which
in turn will release line 5 (unless it had already timed out).

It is important to note that while this code is non-blocking,
it is not parallel. If we wanted to parallelize the two computations,
we could rearrange the code as follows.

```scala
def combined: Future[Int] = async {
  val future1 = slowCalcFuture
  val future2 = slowCalcFuture
  await(future1) + await(future2)
}
```

## Comparison with direct use of `Future` API

This computation could also be expressed by directly using the
higher-order functions of Futures:

```scala
def slowCalcFuture: Future[Int] = ...
val future1 = slowCalcFuture
val future2 = slowCalcFuture
def combined: Future[Int] = for {
  r1 <- future1
  r2 <- future2
} yield r1 + r2
```

The `async` approach has two advantages over the use of
`map` and `flatMap`.
  1. The code more directly reflects the programmers intent,
     and does not require us to name the results `r1` and `r2`.
     This advantage is even more pronounced when we mix control
     structures in `async` blocks.
  2. `async` blocks are compiled to a single anonymous class,
     as opposed to a separate anonymous class for each closure
     required at each generator (`<-`) in the for-comprehension.
     This reduces the size of generated code, and can avoid boxing
     of intermediate results.

## Comparison with CPS plugin

The existing continuations (CPS) plugin for Scala can also be used
to provide a syntactic layer like `async`. This approach has been
used in Akka's [Dataflow Concurrency](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/dataflow.html)

CPS-based rewriting of asynchronous code also produces a closure
for each suspension. It can also lead to type errors that are
difficult to understand.

## How it works

 - The async macro analyses the block of code, looking for control
   structures and locations of await calls. It then breaks the code
   into 'chunks'. Each chunk contains a linear sequence of statements
   that concludes with a branching decision, or with the registration
   of a subsequent state handler as the continuation.
 - Before this analysis and transformation, the program is normalized
   into a form amenable to this manipulation. This is called the
   "A Normal Form" (ANF), and roughly means that:
     - `if` and `match` constructs are only used as statements;
       they cannot be used as an expression.
     - calls to await are not allowed in compound expressions.
 - Identify vals, vars and defs that are accessed from multiple
   states. These will be lifted out to fields in the state machine
   object.
 - Synthesize a class that holds:
   - an integer representing the current state ID
   - the lifted definitions
   - an `apply(value: Try[Any]): Unit` method that will be
     called on completion of each future. The behavior of
     this method is determined by the current state. It records
     the downcast result of the future in a field, and calls the
     `resume()` method.
   - the `resume(): Unit` method that switches on the current state
     and runs the users code for one 'chunk', and either:
       a) registers the state machine as the handler for the next future
       b) completes the result Promise of the async block, if at the terminal state.
   - an `apply(): Unit` method that starts the computation.

## Troubleshooting
 - Logging of the transform can be enabled with `scalac -Dscala.async.debug=true`.
 - Tracing of the ANF transform: `scalac -Dscala.async.trace=true`
 - Debug the macro expansion by checking out the project and executing the application
   [`TreeInterrogation`](https://github.com/scala/async/blob/master/src/test/scala/scala/async/TreeInterrogation.scala#L59)

## Limitations
 - See the [neg](https://github.com/scala/async/tree/master/src/test/scala/scala/async/neg) test cases for
   for constructs that are not allowed in a async block
 - See the [issue list](https://github.com/scala/async/issues?state=open) for which of these restrictions are planned
   to be dropped in the next milestone.
 - See [#13](https://github.com/scala/async/issues/13) for why `await` is not possible in closures, and for suggestions on
   ways to structure the code to work around this limitation.

## Building

The async macro and its test suite can be built and run with SBT.

### Generated Code examples

```scala
val future = async {                                     
 val f1 = async { true }                                 
 val x = 1                                               
 def inc(t: Int) = t + x                                 
 val t = 0                                               
 val f2 = async { 42 }                                   
 if (await(f1)) await(f2) else { val z = 1; inc(t + z) }
}                                                                            
```

After ANF transform.

 - await calls are moved to only appear on the RHS of a value definition.
 - `if` is not used as an expression, instead each branch writes its result
   to a synthetic `var`.

```scala
 {
  ();
  val f1: scala.concurrent.Future[Boolean] = {
    scala.concurrent.Future.apply[Boolean](true)(scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global)
  };
  val x: Int = 1;
  def inc(t: Int): Int = t.+(x);
  val t: Int = 0;
  val f2: scala.concurrent.Future[Int] = {
    scala.concurrent.Future.apply[Int](42)(scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global)
  };
  val await$1: Boolean = scala.async.Async.await[Boolean](f1);
  var ifres$1: Int = 0;
  if (await$1)
    {
      val await$2: Int = scala.async.Async.await[Int](f2);
      ifres$1 = await$2
    }
  else
    {
      ifres$1 = {
        val z: Int = 1;
        inc(t.+(z))
      }
    };
  ifres$1
}
```

After async transform:

 - one class synthesized to act as the state machine. It's `apply()` method will
   be used to start the computation (even the code before the first await call
   is executed asynchronously), and the `apply(tr: scala.util.Try[Any])` method
   will continue after each completed background task.
 - each chunk of code moved into the a branch of the pattern match in `resume$async`.
 - value and method definitions accessed from multiple states are lifted to be
   members of `class stateMachine`. Others remain local, e.g. `val z`.

```scala
 {
  class stateMachine$7 extends StateMachine[scala.concurrent.Promise[Int], scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext] {
    def <init>() = {
      super.<init>();
      ()
    };
    var state$async: Int = 0;
    val result$async: scala.concurrent.Promise[Int] = scala.concurrent.Promise.apply[Int]();
    val execContext$async = scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global;
    var x$1: Int = 0;
    def inc$1(t: Int): Int = t.$plus(x$1);
    var t$1: Int = 0;
    var f2$1: scala.concurrent.Future[Int] = null;
    var await$1: Boolean = false;
    var ifres$1: Int = 0;
    var await$2: Int = 0;
    def resume$async(): Unit = try {
      state$async match {
        case 0 => {
